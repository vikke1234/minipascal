\hypertarget{index_sec0}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{index_sec0}
The project requires the build system {\ttfamily meson} and {\ttfamily ninja}, compilation is trivial; if you want to specify which compiler to use set the environmental variable {\ttfamily CC} before running {\ttfamily meson}. You may install meson with your favorite package manager, it should be available on all major distributions. Non-\/linux platforms that are unix like may work but are not supported. \begin{DoxyVerb} meson setup build && cd build && ninja
\end{DoxyVerb}

{\ttfamily ./minipascal foo.\+mpl}\hypertarget{index_sec2}{}\doxysection{Brief introduction to the minipascal interpreter}\label{index_sec2}
The project interpreter is quite small consisting of $\sim$2000 lines, and each phase is split into it\textquotesingle{}s respective files, parsing can be found in parser.\{h,cpp\} while the lexer is in lexer.\{h,cpp\} etc.

The parser has a quite a bit of boilerplate code due to the nature of making one in C++. In hindsight choosing a functional language such as ocaml would probably have been a beter idea. The different nodes for the AST can be found in \mbox{\hyperlink{expr_8h_source}{expr.\+h}}, recursive descent is used to build the tree.\hypertarget{index_sec3}{}\doxysection{Lexing}\label{index_sec3}
Lexing is implemented in a naive way, simply a bunch of if statements grouped together when encountering a token. Supports most control characters; octal, hexadecimal and unicode code points are not currently supported.\hypertarget{index_sec4}{}\doxysection{Parsing}\label{index_sec4}
Parsing consists of a top-\/down parser (LL(1)), it does not create a parse tree, instead creates an AST directly. You may view the different nodes relationships in the AST with UML diagrams in relevant chapters below. A brief explanation is also shown in \mbox{\hyperlink{index_req_info}{Required info}}. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}

\hypertarget{index_sec5}{}\doxysection{Semantical analysis}\label{index_sec5}
Currently the only semantical analysis done is initialization of variables and type checking. Since minipascal is globally scoped, no scope checking is done.\hypertarget{index_errors}{}\doxysection{Error handling}\label{index_errors}
Error handling is implemented using the crash and burn approach in the parser. It will exit if it encounters a fatal error like missing tokens such as do or end. I did not have enough time to implement proper error handling. The analyser will analyse the entire file though, it will report all errors it finds.

The lexer currently is incapable of detecting non-\/terminated strings, it also implements the crash and burn approach, if it encounters a symbol that is not expected, it will exit.

Future work would consist of adding an error type which has ways to handle such errors. For example skipping tokens until a valid one is encountered and getting a new statement from there.\hypertarget{index_testing}{}\doxysection{Testing}\label{index_testing}
I was not proficient in automatic testing from earlier and I did not have time to learn how to set everything up so all testing has been done manually. Future work would consist of likely adding this next.

I\textquotesingle{}ve used a file which contained all the different constructs of the language. It can be found below\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}var x: int := 10/5;
var y: int;

print y;
y := 123;
print y;
var mybool: bool := !0;
print "foo" + " bar";
print x;
print mybool;

if !(0) do // foo bar
    print "!(0 is true)";
    if x do
        print "truthy!\n";
    end if;
end if;

for x in x..(1 + 20 / 4) do
    print x;
end if;
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \hypertarget{index_hours}{}\doxysection{Hours}\label{index_hours}
Rough estimate of hours, I\textquotesingle{}m very bad at tracking time, I easily forget how much time I\textquotesingle{}ve actually spent.

\hypertarget{index_req_info}{}\doxysection{Required info}\label{index_req_info}
1. A dot is considered any character in this context. An unescaped \textquotesingle{}$\ast$\textquotesingle{} is zero or more, an unescaped \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} is one or more, a pipe \textquotesingle{}$\vert$\textquotesingle{} is or. \begin{DoxyVerb}token = [A-z]+[A-z0-9]*
digit = [0-9]+
string = ".*"
symbols = [!\+-\*<=&/] | :=
language_tokens = (token | digit | symbols | string)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 2. {\ttfamily e} is considered as epsilon in this context. \begin{DoxyVerb}program     -> stmt_list $$
stmt_list   -> stmt stmt_list | e
stmt        -> var id : type := expr;
            | id := expr;
            | print expr
            | read id
            | for id in expr..expr do stmt_list end for
            | if expr do stmt_list do stmt_list if_tail

if_tail     -> else stmt_list | end

type        -> int | string | bool

expr        -> term term_tail
term_tail   -> add_op term term_tail | e
term        -> factor factor_tail
factor_tail -> mult_op factor factor_tail | e
factor      -> ( expr ) | id | digit
add_op      -> + | -
mult_op     -> * | /
\end{DoxyVerb}
 3. See children of \mbox{\hyperlink{classExpr}{Expr}}, TL;DR, tree looks like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{classStatementList}{StatementList}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classExpr}{Expr}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{classStatementList}{StatementList}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{classExpr}{Expr}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{\hyperlink{classStatementList}{StatementList}}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classExpr}{Expr}}} can be any statement (a little confusing naming convention, it was named such at first and now it\textquotesingle{}s a bit too much work to rename it), a binary operation, print etc. \mbox{\hyperlink{classStatementList}{Statement\+List}} is just a tree structure to contain all of the different statements.
