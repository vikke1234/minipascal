0. Building
The project requires the build system `meson` and `ninja`,  compilation is trivial; if you
want to specify which compiler to use set the environmental variable `CC`.

`meson build && cd build && ninja`

0.1. Running
`./minipascal foo.mpl`


1. Brief introduction to the minipascal interpreter

The project interpreter is quite small consisting of ~1000 lines, and each
phase is split into it's respective files, parsing can be found in
parser.{h,cpp} while the lexer is in lexer.{h,cpp} etc.

The parser has a quite a bit of boilerplate code due to the nature of making
one in C++. The different nodes for the AST can be found in expr.h, recursive
descent is used to build the tree.
